        <p><em>Co-Founder of <strong>Communa</strong></em></p>
        <p>My name is Daniel Donenfeld, and I am the Co-Founder of Communa along with my friend Jesse. Communa is a social networking platform that allows for the efficient connection between professionals and clients, based on one's personalized
          network.
          My friend and I created Communa in attempts of eliminating the tedious process of calling friends, posting in Facebook groups, etc. for the best professionals because, evidently, they do not trust the "5 star" professionals on sites such as
          Google, Yelp, Thumbtack, etc. <br> <strong>People would rather use a professional they know nothing about, but their friends use them, rather than a "5 star" professional from Google who none of their friends use.</strong>
